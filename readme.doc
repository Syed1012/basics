3 ways of declaring a variable

- var, let, const [ Before ES-6 (ECMA Script) var was used for all variables, later let and const were introduced in ES6] 

1) var allows multiple same variable creation

2) let doesn't allows multiple same variable creation but allows change of data for that variable

    It is block scoped --> It means it can't be accessed out of a function or a file
    
    Errors:
        Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'a' has already been declared
        Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before initialization

3) const doesn't allows both 1 & 2 features. Once a variable with const is declared with data it can't be changed and neither that variable can be duplicated.

    Errors:
        TypeError:Assignment to constant variable.
        Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier


Global Variable --> It is the variable that is defined outside of the functions, they can be accessed by any fnction directly

local Variable --> It is the variable that is defined inside a function. The availabilty of that variable is limited to that function only.


Data Types --> 1)Primitve DT 2)Non Primitve DT

1)Primitve DT -- Number, String, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Symbol, BigInt

i) Number - let num = 2; // Integer 
            let num2 = 1.3; // Floating point number
            let num3 = Infinity; // Infinity
            let num4 = 'something here too'/2; // NaN

ii) String - let str = "Hello There";
             let str2 = 'Single quotes works fine';
             let phrase = `can embed ${str}`;

There’s no difference between ‘single’ and “double” quotes in javascript. Backticks provide extra functionality as with their help of them we can embed variables inside them.
            let name = "Mukul";
            // embed a variable
            alert( `Hello, ${name}!` ); // Hello, Mukul!

iii) Boolean - let isCoding = true;
               let isWolf = false;

iv) NULL - let age = null;

The ‘null’ data type basically defines a special value that represents ‘nothing’, ’empty’, or ‘value unknown’. 
Undefined Just like null, Undefined makes its own type. The meaning of undefined is ‘value is not assigned’.

        let x;
        console.log(x);  // undefined

2) Non-Primitive DT - Objects

objects -  objects are fundamental data structures used to store collections of data.
           consist of key-value pairs and can be created using curly braces {} or the new keyword.

“object constructor” syntax: let person = new Object(); 
“object literal” syntax: let person = {};

Operators of JS

Below are Arithmetic Operators =>
Addition, subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulus, Exponential (5**3 => it means 5x5x5 -> 125)
Increment ++, Decrement --, Unary (+) Unary ‘+’ is the fastest of converting something into a number.

Assignment Opearators

Comparison Operator =>
Equality (==), Strict Equality (===), Inquality (!=), Strict Inquality (!==)

Terinary Operator =>
Terinary Operator -- It is like the short form of if-else condition. Y = ? A:B 
If the condition is true then Y = A otherwise Y = B
